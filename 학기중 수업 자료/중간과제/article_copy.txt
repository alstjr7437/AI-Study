Denis Mukwege (/mʊkˈweɪɡi/;[1] born 1 March 1955)[2][3] is a Congolese gynecologist and Pentecostal pastor. He founded and works in Panzi Hospital in Bukavu, where he specializes in the treatment of women who have been raped by armed rebels.[4]

In 2018, Mukwege and Iraqi Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for "their efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict".[5]

Denis' continued demand for justice for the victims of the Congo conflict has resulted in him receiving threats against his life and the Panzi hospital. He has received these death threats largely on social media platforms, which emerged from various sources including Mukwege's country of origin, the DRC, and adjoining countries, namely Rwanda and Uganda. Reportedly, the threats have emerged following Denis' increasing calls for perpetrators who were named in a decade-old UN report, to be brought before an international tribunal.[6] A previous assassination attempt was made on Mukwege's life in 2012, which resulted in him and his family leaving the country over concerns for their safety.

Mukwege has treated thousands of women who were victims of rape as a weapon of war since the Second Congo War, some of them more than once, performing up to ten operations a day during his 17-hour working days.[4][7] According to The Globe and Mail, Mukwege is "likely the world's leading expert on repairing injuries of rape".[8] In 2013, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for "his courageous work healing women survivors of war-time sexual violence and speaking up about its root causes."[9] Dr. Mukwege's efforts to bring international attention to the prevalent use of sexual violence as a weapon of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo and his demands for the perpetrators to be brought to justice has resulted in him becoming a renowned activist for human rights and gender equality both within the DRC and internationally
